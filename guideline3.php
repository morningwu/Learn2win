<h5>Example of a Teaching Materials</h5>

<p> --The Example goes here--</p>
<h5>How to prepare “Title Card”?</h5>

<ul>
	<li>A Title Card is the brief description of your video.</li>
	<li>It is to appear at the beginning of your video</li>
	<li>It should freeze for a minimum of 3 seconds (stills) or a maximum of 5 seconds (animation) before the video starts.</li>
	<li>Format: The Title Card is to display the topic of the video in big types; it should be clear and easy to read characters.  e.g. “Breakfast at home”, “Seeing a friend in hospital” etc. </li>  
	<li>Show only the teaching topic, no company name or other information should be shown at the beginning of the video. </li>
	<li><a href="" class="btn">View a sample of a Title Card.</a></li>

</ul>
<h5>How to prepare “Video”?</h5>
<ul>
	<li>The video format should be in MP4.</li>
	<li>Always refer to the “Expected learning outcome” stipulated in this guideline when you prepare your video. </li>
	<li>When you design your contents, try to put in elements listed in “Categories of Text tapes that students should be exposed to and produce” at the expected outcome section. </li>
	<li>Suggested topics of each type of contents: See  “Avaliable topic recruiting”  </li>
	<li><a href="#" target="_blank" class="btn">A reference on video production</a></li>


</ul>
<h5>How to prepare “Study Mission(s)”?</h5>
<ul>
	<li>	“Study Mission” is the exercise and assessment of the video; it reinforces the student’s understanding and act as a test of the video.</li>
	<li>Students learning in our platform differ in their command of English, we need to give different students different ‘study missions” -- some are easier, some are more difficult, according to their levels. </li>
	<li>We need to prepare more questions for the “mission”.  You can see from the below table, we usually have one or two missions for the students after they have seen the video. When we do slice-of-life videos, we expect to have at least 2 missions for students to answer; others should be one mission. </li>
	<li>	Always refer to the “Expected learning outcome” stipulated in this guideline when you prepare your study mission. </li>
	<li>Again, the more creative and innovations are welcome. </li>
	<li>Please see our “Study mission” table  below: </li>
